A map is a reference to the dat a st ruc ture cre ate d by make. When a map is passed to a func-
tion, the function receives a copy of the reference, so any changes the cal le d func tion makes to
the underly ing dat a st ruc ture will be visible through the cal ler’
s map reference too. In our
example, the values inserted int o the countsmap by countLinesare seen by main.
The versions of dup ab ove operate in a ‘‘st reaming’’ mo de in which inp ut is read and bro ken
into lines as needed, so in princip le these programs can handle an arbit rar y amount of inp ut.
An alt ernat ive appro ach is to read the ent ire inp ut int o memory in one big gulp, split it int o
lines all at once, then pro cess the lines. The fol low ing version, dup3, operates in that fashion.
It int roduces the function ReadFile (f rom the io/ioutil package), which reads the ent ire
cont ents of a name d file, and strings.Split, which splits a str ing int o a slice of subst rings.
(Splitis the opp osite of strings.Join, which we saw earlier.)
We’
ve simplified dup3some what. First, it only reads name d files, not the stand ard inp ut, since
ReadFile re quires a file name argument. Secon d, we mov ed the count ing of the lines back
into main, since it is now needed in only one place.
